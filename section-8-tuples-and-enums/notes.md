## Intro to Tuples:

- Next, we will introduce a data type that is __ONLY__ available in `TypeScript` and that is commonly known as the `Tuple` type.

- In short, `Tuples` are `arrays` that have a fixed length and furthermore, the items within the array will be a specific `type` of data.

- This means that each element within the array will not only need to be a specific type but the items need to follow the pattern that is defined within the `tuple`

EXAMPLE 1:

```typescript
let stuff: string[] = ['tesadfs', 'asdfsdfdf', 'asdfasf'];
```

- We have seen the example above before
